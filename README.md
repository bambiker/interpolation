“Clusters Unifying Through Hiding” Interpolation  (CUTHI)

An addition to IDW interpolation that improves accuracy and eliminates the bull's-eye effect.

Look at the [cuthi.ipynb](cuthi.ipynb) to copy the function code and the example code.

You can easily add additional weights to the interpolation, for example, land use. If you can't do it on your own, you can add an issue and I will add this option.
